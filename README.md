This script is designed for the quantitative analysis of puncta in HEK cells following calcium stimulation and subsequent EGTA treatment. It processes multi-channel TIFF images, extracting and comparing puncta between different treatment stages. The script is implemented in ImageJ and automates the workflow from image opening to data extraction and result storage, focusing on co-condensates between channels 1 and 2.

Features
Channel Management: Automatically handles the splitting of image channels. Channel 1 is the CaMKII channel, channel 2 is the gluN2B channel and the remaining channel is the cell fill.

ROI Management: Identifies and creates Regions of Interest (ROIs) for each channel based on automated thresholding.

Data Extraction: Measures areas and generates statistics for puncta and total cell area, making results comparable across different cells.

Result Management: Saves measurements in CSV format and ROIs in ZIP files for further analysis.

Prerequisites:
ImageJ installed with necessary plugins for handling TIFF files and ROI management.
Images should be stored in a specific directory and named with a three-digit prefix that represents a unique identifier.

Workflow Description
Initialization: Opens the image, sets the scale and contrast, and prepares the image by zooming and enhancing visual details.

Image Processing:
Splits the image into its constituent channels.
Duplicates channels for separate analyses: measurement, puncta analysis, and area calculation.

Cell Area ROI Handling:
Applies Otsu's method for thresholding to convert images to binary masks for cell area quantification.
Creates selections and adds them to the ROI Manager.
Handles cases where no valid selection can be made by creating dummy ROIs.

Measurement and Saving:
Extracts statistical data for each puncta ROI and measures areas.
Results are saved in CSV files; ROIs are stored in ZIP files for each channel and condition.

Running the Script
Place your images in the specified directory accessible by ImageJ.
Open the script in ImageJâ€™s script editor.
Execute the script. Ensure that ImageJ has sufficient resources allocated to handle large image files and multiple operations.

Output Files
ROI Sets: ZIP files containing the ROIs for each treatment and channel.
Measurement Results: CSV files detailing the areas and other statistics for each analyzed ROI.

Notes
The script includes comments for potential adjustments and troubleshooting, particularly regarding metadata issues that might affect channel renaming.
Make sure to adjust the zoom and location settings in the script according to your monitor setup and image resolution.
